# Swift Musicology
A library for music theory, written in swift.


Requirements
----
- Swift 4.0+
- iOS 8.0+


Installation
----
Create the framework and then drag and drop to your app. Make sure to add it to "Link Frameworks and Libraries" in your project's General settings

Usage
----

`SwiftMusicology` will give you access to a few fairly simple enums and structs which can be used to define nearly any music related data. For most people, the most commonly used of these will be the  `Pitch`, `Key`, `Scale` and `Chord` enums.

It should be noted that all data types conform to `Codable`, `CustomStringConvertable` protocols.  Furthermore, `Pitch`, and `Accidental` structs are `RawPresentable` with `Int` as well as `ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral` in order for them to be directly expressed with `Int`s.

#### `Pitch` and `Key`

- All keys can be defined with `Key` struct.  It has a `KeyType` where you can set the base key like C, D, A#, or Fb. All  keys must be initialised with an  `Accidental`  which can be `.natural`, `.flat`, `sharp` or something more custom such as`.sharps(amount: 3)`.
- `Pitch`es are created with with a `Key` and octave. You may also create `Pitch`es with MIDI note number.  `rawValue` of a pitch is its MIDI note number.
- The `Pitch`, `Key`, `Accidental` structs have had custom operators defined for equatable, `+` and `-` in order to make calulations easier.
- Finally, these structs can be defined with strings as well, though, for specificity's sake, it is advisable to not do so.

``` swift
let gFlat = Key(type: g, accidental: .flat)
let a4 = Pitch(key: Key(type: .a), octave: 4)
let dSharp: Key = "d#" // Is the equivalent of `Key(type: .a, accidental: .sharp)`
let aFlat3: Pitch = "ab3" // or "aâ™­3" or "Ab3" is Pitch(key: (type: .a, accidental: .flat), octave: 3)
```

#### `Interval`

- Intervals are the semitones between pitches.
- They are `IntegerLiteral` and you can add or subsctract them between themselves, `Pitches` or `NoteType`s.
- You can define a custom interval with its quality, degree and semitone properties.
- Minor, major, perfect, augmented and diminished intervals, up to 2 octaves, are predefined for convenience.

#### `ScaleType` and `Scale`

- `ScaleType` enum exists as a covenient shortcut providing a substantial amount of predefined scales from standard Major/Minor to more exotic scales such as Promethean Neopolitan or Six Tone Symmetrical. You are also able to create a custom `ScaleType` in the following manner: `ScaleType.custom(intervals: [Interval], description: String)` 
- `Scale` defines a scale with a `ScaleType` and root `Key`. You are then able to, based on the existing scale, generate can generate notes of that scale in an octave range or it's `HarmonicField` which is all the possible triad, tetrad or extended chords in a scale.

``` swift
let gLocrian = Scale(type: .locrian, key: Key(type: .g))
```

#### `ChordType` and `Chord`

- `ChordType` is a struct with `ChordPart`s which are the basic blocks of building chords. You can define any chord existing with `ChordType`. Thirds, fifths, sixths, sevenths and other extensions are parts of the `ChordType` as separate structs which also conform to the `ChordPart` protocol.
- `Chord` defines chords with type and a root key. This allows you to generate the notes of any chord in any octave range as well as in any inversion.


``` swift
let m13 = ChordType(third: .minor, seventh: .dominant, extensions: [ChordExtensionType(type: .thirteenth)])
let dm13 = Chord(type: m13, key: Key(type: .d))
```

#### `Tempo` and `TimeSignature`

- Tempo is a helper struct to define timings in your music app which consists of a `TimeSignature` and beats per minute. `TimeSignature` is the number of beats per measure and the  `NoteValue` of each beat. `NoteValue` defines the note's duration in a beat. It could be whole note, half note, quarter note, 8th, 16th, 32nd, or 64th note.



Unit Tests
----

Unit Tests are still being written. However, the library has currently been tested and is a fully operational battlesh... framework.
